-To run q1 to  q2.4 simply step through the proj.ipynb notebook but avoid the blocks with gridsearches as I used those to find best parameters which I trained the models with
with (you can run these blocks as i passed the values as parameters to train the model as i did not want to explicitly gridsearch everytime while working on the project as I already found the parameters before hand)
meaning you have the chance of running gridsearch again and using the values you find to replace the ones i hardcoded by playing the grid search blocks or trust the ones I found as legitimate and only train the classifiers with cv variable name
- we wrote a utility function that for q1 to 2.4 appends to a file called performance which I included the classification report and matrix and after playin through the notebook
you should have all the models and result appended to the file (you might want to clear the file before rerunnig if you wish to overwrite my reports)
- For some mlp with no max_iter set you might want to stop training early so as not to waste your time
